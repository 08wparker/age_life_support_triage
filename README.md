# age_life_support_triage

The **Common Longitudinal ICU Data Format (CLIF)** is a standardized longitudinal (long) tidy dataset with one observation per patient per hour designed to study critically ill patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU). These are clinical areas of the hospital where patients receive high frequency monitoring, such as hourly vital signs and nursing assessments. The basic CLIF contains demographics (age, sex, self-identified race and ethnicity), chronic condition data (summarized with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality elixhauser score, and Charlston comorbidity index), nine-digit zip code, time-dependent clinical variables (laboratory markers of end-organ function, COVID status, vital signs, nursing assessments), time-dependent treatment variables (respiratory support, vasoactive drips, continuous renal replacement therapy) and a status variable to denote the patient's status and location at the end of the hour interval.


This README file contains detailed instructions for coding your healthcare system's EHR data into CLIF. This repository also contains two analysis scripts, both of which accepts a clean, long form patient dataset in CLIF.

1. quality_control_check.rmd - performs various quality control checks on the data
2. simulation_inputs.rmd - generates a set of aggregate inputs for the ICU Crisis Simulation Model (ICSM), a discrete event microsimulation model of ICU allocation in a crisis scenario. CLIF was first designed for this application.


## Sample of data prepared in CLIF

Below is a sample patient in record prepared in CLIF.

| encounter | time_icu | sofa_total | age | sex |race  | ethnicity    | elix_ahrq |charlson    | vent | status | covid |  zip       |
|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|-------|-------|--------------|----------|------------|------|--------|-------|------------|
| 1         | 0        | 6          | 75        | male |White | Non-hispanic |19        | 3          | 0    | icu    |  1    | XXXXX-YYYY |
| 1         | 1        | 6          | 75        | male |White | Non-hispanic |19        | 3          | 0    | icu    |  1    | XXXXX-YYYY |
| 1         | 2        | 7          | 75        | male |White | Non-hispanic |19        | 3          | 0    | icu    |  1    | XXXXX-YYYY |

Only key columns are included in sample above, but the full CLIF contains all the data variables mentioned below as well as all SOFA sub-components.

**encounter** is an ID variable for each ICU stay (so a given patient can have multiple values), so please also include a second **patient** ID variable.

## Patient populations for CLIF

What exactly consitutes an ICU varies significantly between hospitals. When preparing data in CLIF, be inclusive of all patients who are considered ICU status, as collaborators writing scripts prepared for CLIF can filter down to their desired patient population. For example, the study population for the ICSM project is all patients who would unambiguously need life-support in an ICU during a crisis (inclusion criteria below).

1) requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation
2) hypoxic respiratory failure with an estimated arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen gas (FiO2) ratio less than 200 on high-flow nasal cannula
3) continuous vasoactive drips or mechanical circulatory support for shock
4) ECMO for either shock or respiratory failure

Operationally, this includes all patients with a respiratory SOFA > 2 *or* a cardiovascular SOFA > 2 *or* invasive/non-invasive mechanical ventilation.

## Race and ethnicity cateogries

Use the patient's self-identified race and ethnicity as documented in the electronic medical record per the american census definitions.

### Race categories
* White
* Black or African American
* Asian American
* Native Hawiian or Other Pacific Islander
* American Indian or Alaska Native
* Other              

### Ethnicity
Please include ethnicity as a seperate binary indicator variable
* Hispanic
* Non-hispanic


## Comorbidity calculation

Please report the ARHQ Elixhauser score (Moore et al., 2017), weighted VW Elixhauser (van Walraven et al. 2009), and Charlson index (Charlson 1987) calculated from ICD codes with the [comorbidity](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/comorbidity/index.html) package in R

Different analyses can use this data in different ways. For example, `simulation_inputs.Rmd` will assign comoribidity category cutoffs for the simulation matrices in a standardized way across datasets

## Status variable

Factor with three levels **(icu, recovered, died)**

* icu - currently admitted to ICU
* recovered - last observation in ICU with successful discharge to floor
* died - death in ICU or discharge to hospice (including floor transfers that went to hospice) 

Notes: 
1. Code transfers to nursing facilities or home as **recovered**
2. Code deaths that occur after transfer to the wards but prior to discharge as **recovered**
3. Code discharge to hospice from the ICU are coded as **died**, regardless of exactly when/where the patient dies 

## SOFA Coding Details

To standardize SOFA coding between sites, please follow the best practices below. 

### General

* If there are missing values, code 0 for that item until the lab/vital sign appears
* Carryforward values from previous observations. For example, if the Creatine was 1.5 at 9:00 AM earning a Renal Score of 1, the patient's Renal Score remains 1 until a new creatinine value is recorded.
    * SOFA respiratory score from P/F and SOFA renal score from dialysis have carryforward time-limits, see below for details

### SOFA CARDS
Only number of pressors matters, not dose.

* 2 or more pressors -> 4
* 1 pressor -> 3
* Dobutamine alone -> 2
* Map < 70 -> 1
* MAP >70, no pressors -> 0


### SOFA respiratory

* P/F <=100 -> 4 (must be on respiratory support)
* P/F 100-200 -> 3 (must be on respiratory support)
* P/F 200-300 ->  2
* P/F 300-400 -> 1
* P/F >400 -> 0

If PaO2/FiO2 is not available *or is more than 4 hours old*, use the SaO2/FiO2:
* SF<=150 -> 4 (must be on respiratory support)
* SF 150-235 -> 3 (must be on respiratory support)
* SF 235-315 ->  2
* SF 315-400 -> 1
* SF >400 -> 0

In other words, use the respiratory SOFA calculated from a blood gas for 4 hours after collection, then default back to SaO2/FiO2 ratio (unless a new blood gas has been drawn)


#### Notes:
* Treat all high-level ICU respiratory support equivalently, i.e. make no distinction between mechanical ventilation, NIPPV (CPAP/BiPAP), high-flow
* patients on low-flow nasal cannula can get at most a resp SOFA of 2
* To estimate the FiO2 for a patient on low-flow nasal cannula, use the following formula where LPM = liters per minute of low-flow oxygen
      * Fi02 = 0.24 + 0.04*(LPM)

* Max SOFA score on low-flow nasal cannula is 2.

* for patients on room air, set FiO2 = 0.21. Patients on room air should almost always have a respiratory SOFA of 0.


### SOFA renal 
Ignore urine output, use creatine criteria only 
* Cr < 1.2 -> 0
* Cr 1.2-1.9 -> 1
* Cr 2.0 - 3.4 -> 2
* Cr 3.5 - 4.9 -> 3
* Cr > 5.0 or on dialysis -> 4

After a dialysis session, the patient's SOFA renal score of 4 carries forward for 72 hours.

### SOFA liver

total bilirubin in mg/dl

* < 1.2 -> 0
* 1.2-1.9 -> 1
* 2.0-5.9 -> 2
* 6 - 11.9 -> 3
* > 12 -> 4

### SOFA Coagulation

Platelet count in 10^3 per uL

* > 150 -> 0
* 100-150 -> 1
* 50-100 -> 2
* 20-50 -> 3
* < 20 -> 4

### SOFA Central Nervous System
By recorded Glascow Coma Scale (GCS). If GCS is missing, a score of zero is assigned
* GCS = 15 ->0
* GCS 13-14 -> 1,
* GCS 10-12 -> 2,
* GCS 6-9 -> 3,
* GCS 0-5 -> 4


## Other notes
* Do not need to filter out patients who are still in the hospital at the end of follow-up. Can use their censored data in many applications, for example the ICSM transition matrices.
* 9-digit zip code is preferred for more granular mapping to measures like the the Area Deprivation Index (https://rdrr.io/cran/sociome/man/get_adi.html)
